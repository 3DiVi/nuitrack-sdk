# TVico User Guide

**TVico** is an interactive Android computer with a 3D sensor and an RGB camera, a product jointly developed by Orbbec and 3DiVI Inc. It is designed for development of interactive Android applications and bundled with Nuitrack SDK.

</p>

There are two options for development with TVico:

1. **TVico** as a standalone computer (see [Standalone case](#standalone-case)): apps are installed and run on TVico. TVico is connected to any TV via HDMI.

2. **TVico** as a peripheral (see [Wireless case](#wireless-case)) (network connection is used). In this case, TVico acts as a server and your Android device/PC acts as a client:
    * **Android**: can be used with Mobile AR/VR HMD. Apps are installed and run on your Android device.
    * **Windows/Linux**: apps are installed and run on your PC (only skeleton info is transferred).

_**Note**: TVico (server) and your Android device/PC (client) should be linked to the same network._

Please see the installation instructions for both cases below.

## Standalone case

1. Download [Nuitrack.apk](http://download.3divi.com/Nuitrack/platforms/Nuitrack.apk).
2. Install *Nuitrack.apk* on TVico following the [installation instructions for Android](Install.md#android).
3. Launch the Nuitrack application.
4. Click **Compatibility test** and wait until the test is complete.
5. Enter your secret key and press **Upgrade to Pro**.
6. Your device will get license from the activation server and after that Nuitrack will be fully-functional on this device (without 3 minute time limit).
7. Press **Test/Run** to test Nuitrack middleware.

_**Note**: Check out our [free Android motion controlled games for TVico](https://tvico.io/#rec84627112) developed with **Nuitrack SDK**. You can use these demo games as a reference for development of your own Android games. Please note that **Nuitrack.apk** installed on TVico is required._
