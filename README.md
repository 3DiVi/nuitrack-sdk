## What is Nuitrack™ SDK?

<p align="center"><a href="https://nuitrack.com/"><img src="doc/img/nuitrack-teaser.gif" width="70%" /></a></p>

**Nuitrack™** is an ultimate 3D body tracking solution developed by **[3DiVi Inc](https://www.3divi.com/)**.

It enables skeletal tracking and body motion analytics applications for virtually any widespread 
- depth sensors (Orbbec Astra, Kinect v1/v2, [Kinect Azure](https://youtu.be/K7O-361UlfI), [Intel Realsense](https://youtu.be/gMPtV4NXtUo), Asus Xtion, LIPS, Structure Sensor, etc.)
- hardware platforms (x64, x86, ARMv7, ARMv8)
- OSes (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS)
- and development environments (C++, C#, [Python](/PythonNuitrack-beta), [Unity](/Unity3D), Unreal)

Being initially inspired by Microsoft Kinect, **Nuitrack™**'s mission is to provide strong skeletal tracking baseline for next generation of immersive and analytical applications beyond any specific platform or hardware. Think of it as *"Kinect for anything"*.

With its performance and flexibility resulting from 10 years of development **Nuitrack™** is capable to support wide range of applications:
- starting from a real-time gesture recognition on small-footprint embedded platform like [Raspberry Pi4](https://youtu.be/qyt4U7ZBj90) 
- to a large-scale multisensor analytical system (which is launched on 18-Cores workstation system)

Now it's all yours - Try it, Use it, Challenge it!
