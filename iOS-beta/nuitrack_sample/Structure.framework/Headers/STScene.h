/** Common data shared and updated by the SLAM pipeline.

An STScene object contains information about the sensor and the reconstructed mesh.

Special care should be taken when accessing STScene members if an STTracker or STMapper is still active, as they could be accessing the STScene from background threads.
In particular, STMesh objects should be properly locked.

/** Render the scene mesh from the given viewpoint.

A virtual camera with the given projection and pose matrices will be used to render the mesh using OpenGL. This method is generally faster than using sceneMeshRef and manually rendering it, since in most cases STScene can reuse mesh data previously uploaded to the GPU.

@param cameraPose A GLKMatrix4 camera position used for rendering.
@param glProjection Projection matrix used during rendering. See also [STDepthFrame glProjectionMatrix] and [STColorFrame glProjectionMatrix].
@param alpha A float value for transparency between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque)
@param highlightOutOfRangeDepth Whether the areas of the mesh which are below Structure Sensor minimal depth range should be highlighted in red.
@param wireframe Whether to render a wireframe of the mesh or filled polygons. When enabled, STMapper needs to be initialized with the `kSTMapperEnableLiveWireFrameKey` option set to `@YES`.

@return TRUE on success, FALSE if there is no STMapper attached to the same STScene with the corresponding (wireframe or triangles) live mode enabled.
