/** Capture Session Delegate

The interface that your application-specific class must implement in order to receive capture session callbacks.

These callbacks replace the previous callbacks used when initializing the iOS camera and Structure Sensor separately.

@warning When creating a new application implementing a sensor controller delegate, the main `Info.plist` needs to contain an additional key "`Supported external accessory protocols`", with the following array of values:

 - `io.structure.control`
 - `io.structure.depth`
 - `io.structure.infrared`

Without this modification to the plist, the app will not be able to connect to the sensor. All sample apps have this key/value array.

    [STCaptureSession newCaptureSession].delegate = self;

 - STLensDetectorOn : This delegate will be notified of the lens it detects, after setting `_captureSession.lens` to that value (if known).
 - STLensDetectorWarnOnMismatch : The delegate will be notified of the lens it detects, but does not change the lens type that the capture session has set.

In all cases above the lens type can still be set manually, however be wary of
setting the lens type manually when the lens detector is on (not WarnOnMismatch),

Examples of this include color camera exposure, white balance, etc. A simple

set to auto, and will be automatically handled by iOS.

@warning It is an error to try and set auto-exposure and a locked ISO value. An exception will be raised if this combination of keys are used.

You can identify which keys correspond to dynamic properties, as keys will be
named kSTCaptureSessionPropertyXXX.

- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertyIOSCameraFocusModeKey` :
  - Specifies what mode to set the color camera focus to.
  - `NSInteger` integral value equal to one of the `STCaptureSessionIOSCameraFocusMode` constants.
  - Defaults to a locked focus position set at calibration time.
- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertyIOSCameraExposureModeKey` :
  - Specifies what mode to set the color camera exposure to.
  - `NSInteger` integral value equal to one of the `STCaptureSessionIOSCameraExposureMode` constants.
  - Defaults to auto exposure.
- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertyIOSCameraISOModeKey` :
  - Specifies what mode to set the color camera ISO to.
  - `NSInteger` integral value equal to one of the `STCaptureSessionIOSCameraISOMode` constants.

  - `NSInteger` integral value equal to one of the `STCaptureSessionIOSCameraWhiteBalanceMode` constants.
  - Defaults to auto white balance.

  - Specifies what mode to set the IR sensor exposure to (Mark II sensors only, currently).
  - `NSInteger` integral value equal to one of the `STCaptureSessionSensorIRExposureMode` constants.
  - Defaults to a locked exposure determined by the sensor depth preset that is chosen.

The following properties represent the values to use when locking one or more of
the above color camera properties to a custom value. The units represent what one
would typically use when using the standard AVCaptureDevice API.

- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertyIOSCameraFocusValueKey` :
  - Specifies what position in [0.0 1.0] to set the focus lens position of the color camera.
  - `NSFloat` float value equal to the focus position desired.

- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertyIOSCameraExposureValueKey` :
  - Specifies what length of time (in seconds) to set for the color camera exposure.
  - `NSFloat` float value equal to the time in seconds to use as the target color camera exposure.
- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertyIOSCameraISOValueKey` :
  - Specifies what ISO speed to set for the color camera ISO.
  - `NSFloat` float value equal to the desired ISO of the color camera.

  - `NSFloat` float value equal to the time in seconds to use as the target IR / Depth exposure
- `kSTCaptureSessionPropertySensorIRAnalogGainValueKey` :
  - Specifies what analog gain mode (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x) to set on the IR sensor (Mark II only)
  - `NSInteger` integral value equal to one of the `STCaptureSessionSensorAnalogGainMode` constants.
