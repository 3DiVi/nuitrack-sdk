/** Sensor Controller Delegate
 
The interface that your application-specific class must implement in order to receive sensor controller callbacks.
 
@warning When creating a new application implementing a sensor controller delegate, the main `Info.plist` needs to contain an additional key "`Supported external accessory protocols`", with the following array of values:
 
 - `io.structure.control`
 - `io.structure.depth`
 - `io.structure.infrared`
 
Without this modification to the plist, the app will not be able to connect to the sensor. All sample apps have this key/value array.
 
See also <[STSensorController sharedController]> & <[STSensorController delegate]>.
 
Delegate Registration Example:
 
    [ STSensorController sharedController ].delegate = self;

- `kSTFrameSyncConfigKey`:
  - Specifies whether frame sync should be active.
  - `NSNumber` integral value equal to one of the STFrameSyncConfig constants.
  - Defaults to `STFrameSyncOff`.
  - When active, depth frame will be synchronized with the color frames from AVFoundation.
- `kSTHoleFilterEnabledKey`:
  - Specifies whether to enable depth frame hole filtering.
  - `NSNumber` boolean value.
  - Defaults to `@YES` if the stream configuration includes depth.
  - When active, it enables a dilation filter over depth values that has the effect of filling holes.
  - Setting it to `@YES` if the stream configuration does not include depth is invalid.
- `kSTHighGainEnabledKey`:
  - Specifies whether to enable high gain mode.
  - `NSNumber` boolean value.
  - Defaults to `@NO`.
  - When set to `@YES` the sensor gain will be increased, causing better performance in dark or far away objects at the expense of some bright nearby objects.

- `kSTColorCameraFixedLensPositionKey`:
  - Specifies a fixed lens position for the color camera.
  - `NSNumber` floating point value.
  - Required when using a registered depth mode.
  - The focus of the color camera has to remain fixed to this value when using a registered depth mode.
