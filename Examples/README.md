# Nuitrack Demo Programs 

Nuitrack SDK includes a set of sample C++ and C# demo programs that you can build and run to check the Nuitrack features, such as skeleton tracking, hand tracking, gesture recognition, etc. The instructions on building and running the samples are given in the `README` files in the corresponding folders. 

| Example | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [Nuitrack console sample](/Examples/nuitrack_console_sample) | This simple example shows how to use Nuitrack to get a user's right hand position. The example covers the basic stages of the Nuitrack API usage: initialization, module creation, callback registration, Nuitrack startup, data retrieval, and resource release. The received data is displayed in the console. |
| [Nuitrack OpenGL sample](/Examples/nuitrack_gl_sample) | This example shows how to use Nuitrack to get a depth map, data on the tracking of users, skeletons, hands, and gesture recognition. In the example, the resulting data is rendered using OpenGL. |
| [Nuitrack OpenGL sample with OpenNI API](/Examples/nuitrack_ni_gl_sample) | This example is similar to the previous one, but it is based on the OpenNI API. |
| [Nuitrack C# sample](/Examples/nuitrack_csharp_sample) | This simple C# example shows how to use Nuitrack to get a depth map, data on the tracking of users, skeletons, hands, and gesture recognition. |
| [Nuitrack Device API sample](/Examples/nuitrack_device_api_sample) | This example shows how to use Nuitrack ะก++ Device API to select and activate a device with the Nuitrack C++ API. |
| [Nuitrack C# Device API sample](/Examples/nuitrack_csharp_device_api_sample) | This example shows how to use Nuitrack ะก# Device API to select and activate a device with the Nuitrack C# API. |
| [Nuitrack Android Studio GL sample](/Examples/nuitrack_android_studio_gl_sample) | This example shows how to use Nuitrack in Android Studio to get a depth map, data on the tracking of users, skeletons, hands, and gesture recognition. In the example, the resulting data is rendered using OpenGL. |
| [Room Demo (Unity)](/Examples/Room_Unity3D_Demo.zip) | This is a sample VR application for VicoVR. In this project, a user's skeleton is detected and tracked. The avatar is standing in front of a mirror in a virtual room. |
| [VicoVR Demo (Unity)](/Examples/VicoVR_Unity3D_Demo.zip) | This Unity sample shows you how to use Nuitrack to track a user's skeleton and segment, get a depth map from the sensor, and create a point cloud. |
